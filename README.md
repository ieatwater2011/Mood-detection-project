Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how detectNet can be utilized beyond its typical object detection capabilities to analyze more nuanced visual information, specifically human emotions. By integrating detectNet with a mood classification layer (either directly within the detectNet model's output or through post-processing), the system can identify faces in a video stream or image and then classify the mood associated with each detected face. This could be applied in areas like interactive art installations, user experience analysis, or assistive technologies.

detectNet is a high-performance object detection inference library and a command-line tool provided by NVIDIA's jetson-inference repository. It's optimized for NVIDIA Jetson platforms (such as Jetson Nano, Xavier NX, etc.) and allows for real-time object detection using various pre-trained models (like SSD, Faster R-CNN, YOLO) or custom models. In this project, detectNet is primarily used for face detection, and the subsequent mood classification can be handled by either:

A detectNet model specifically trained for facial expression recognition.

A separate classification model that takes the detected face regions as input.

Features
Real-time Face Detection: Utilizes detectNet to accurately identify and localize human faces in live video streams or static images.

Mood Classification: Infers mood (e.g., happy, sad, neutral, angry, surprised, disgusted, fearful) from detected faces.

Visual Feedback: Overlays bounding boxes around detected faces and displays the inferred mood.

Configurable Inputs: Supports various input sources (webcam, video files, image directories).

Performance Optimized: Designed to run efficiently on NVIDIA Jetson platforms, leveraging GPU acceleration.

Technologies Used
NVIDIA Jetson Platform: (e.g., Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavier NX) - The target hardware for optimized performance.

JetPack SDK: NVIDIA's comprehensive software stack for the Jetson platform.

jetson-inference library: Specifically, the detectNet component for deep learning inference.

detectNet: NVIDIA's optimized library for real-time object detection on Jetson devices. For this project, it's used for face detection.

Python 3: The primary programming language for the application logic.

OpenCV: For image and video processing, including capturing camera feeds and drawing overlays.

TensorFlow / PyTorch (Optional): If using a separate, custom-trained mood classification model.

Setup and Installation
Before proceeding, ensure you have an NVIDIA Jetson device with JetPack SDK installed. This project assumes you have already set up the jetson-inference repository.

Clone jetson-inference (if you haven't already):

git clone https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
cd jetson-inference
git submodule update --init

Build jetson-inference:
Follow the build instructions in the jetson-inference repository. This typically involves:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

During the cmake step, you might be prompted to download various models. Ensure you download a face detection model (e.g., facenet-120) for detectNet.

Prepare Mood Detection Model:

Option A (Pre-trained detectNet for Mood): If a detectNet model specifically trained for facial expressions is available, ensure it's downloaded and accessible by detectNet. This might involve adding it to the jetson-inference/data/networks directory or specifying its path.

Option B (Separate Classification Model): If you're using a separate model (e.g., a small CNN in TensorFlow/PyTorch) for mood classification:

Place your model files (e.g., .h5, .pt, .onnx) in a models/mood_classifier directory within your project.

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., tensorflow, torch, torchvision, onnxruntime).

pip install tensorflow # or pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

Clone this project:

cd .. # Go back to your desired parent directory
git clone https://github.com/ieatwater2011/final.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd final

Install Python dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy

If you're using a separate mood classifier, install its dependencies as well.

Usage
This project typically involves a Python script that uses the detectNet API.

Run the Mood Detection Script:

python mood_detector.py --input_device=/dev/video0 --output_display=1

Command-line Arguments:

--network=<model_name>: (Optional) Specify the detectNet model to use for face detection (e.g., facenet-120). Default is often facenet-120.

--input_device=<path_or_id>: Input source.

/dev/video0: For a webcam.

my_video.mp4: For a video file.

images/: For a directory of images.

--output_display=<0_or_1>: Set to 1 to display the output window, 0 otherwise.

--threshold=<value>: (Optional) Confidence threshold for face detection (e.g., 0.5).

--mood_model_path=<path>: (Optional, if using separate mood model) Path to your mood classification model.

Example:

To run with a webcam and display the output:

python mood_detector.py --input_device=/dev/video0 --output_display=1

To process a video file and save the output to another video file:

python mood_detector.py --input_device=input_video.mp4 --output_file=output_mood_video.mp4
